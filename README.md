# MyFirstTask
This is a task from where I was learning. I wanted to post it here as a reminder for me when I start and as a measure of how much could I grow in the future as well. Since two years ago I was wishing to find a way to work fully remote with technology. Even I haven´t reached some of my main goals, I have to admit that Web Development has been a very useful tool for me and it gives me another reason to keep movingo forward. 🙌🏻♥️🚀🌎👾
